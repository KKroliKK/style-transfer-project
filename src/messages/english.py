hello = 'Hello!\nI am Style Transfer Bot based on neural network.\n\n\
Neural style transfer is an optimization technique which is used for \
generating images from two original photos: style image (for example\
, a work of art by a famous artist) and a content image.\n\
After mixing them together we obtain output image which looks \
like a content image, but is "drawn" in the style of the reference \
image of the style.\n\n With me you can mix any two photos and enjoy \
the result.\n'

you will need two photos: style and content as in the example below:\n'

to process the photo.\n'
